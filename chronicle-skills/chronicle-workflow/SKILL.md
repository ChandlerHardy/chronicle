# Chronicle Workflow

This skill guides you through the complete Chronicle workflow for tracking and documenting development work.

## When to Use This Skill

Use this skill when:
- User is starting a new development session
- Setting up Chronicle for the first time
- Want to ensure all work is being tracked
- Need guidance on Chronicle best practices
- Building a comprehensive development knowledge base

## Complete Workflow

### 1. Session Start (If Not Already Tracking)

**Check if in Chronicle session:**
- Current session is likely NOT being tracked unless started with `chronicle start claude`
- To track current work, user must exit and restart with Chronicle

**Guide user:**
```bash
# Exit current session
exit

# Start new Chronicle-tracked session
chronicle start claude

# Or for other tools:
chronicle start gemini
```

**Important:** Chronicle sessions must be started explicitly - they don't auto-track.

### 2. During Development

**Best Practices:**
- Work naturally - Chronicle captures everything automatically
- Make frequent git commits with descriptive messages
- Chronicle links commits to sessions automatically (Â±30 min window)

**Available Commands (don't interrupt work to run these):**
```bash
chronicle sessions              # List recent sessions
chronicle show today           # See today's commits
chronicle timeline today       # Combined view
```

### 3. Session End

**Automatic on Exit:**
- Full transcript captured to `~/.ai-session/sessions/session_N.log`
- Metadata saved (duration, timestamp, repo)
- Session record created in database

**What happens:**
```
ðŸ“Š Session #{id} complete! Duration: {minutes} minutes
ðŸ’¾ Full transcript saved
âœ¨ Use 'chronicle session {id}' to view
```

### 4. Post-Session Documentation

**Generate Summary (Automatic on first view):**
```bash
# View session and auto-generate summary
chronicle session {id}

# For very large sessions (>50K lines)
chronicle summarize-chunked {id}
```

**Document to Obsidian:**
Use the `chronicle-session-documenter` skill or manually:
```
"Document session {id} to my Obsidian vault"
```

### 5. Retrieval & Context

**Find Past Work:**
Use the `chronicle-context-retriever` skill:
```
"How did I implement authentication last time?"
"What was the blocker with database migrations?"
"Show me all work on the API refactor"
```

**Browse Sessions:**
```bash
# Filter by repo
chronicle sessions --repo /path/to/project

# View timeline
chronicle timeline week
```

## Workflow Patterns

### Pattern 1: Quick Feature Work
```
1. chronicle start claude
2. [Make changes, commit]
3. exit
4. [Summary auto-generates on next view]
```

### Pattern 2: Multi-Session Project
```
1. chronicle start claude (Day 1)
2. [Work, commit]
3. exit
4. Document to Obsidian
5. chronicle start claude (Day 2)
6. "What did I do yesterday?" (retrieves context)
7. [Continue work]
```

### Pattern 3: Research & Context
```
1. "Show me all sessions about X" (context retriever)
2. Review past approaches and decisions
3. chronicle start claude
4. [Implement with informed approach]
```

## Multi-Project Tracking

**Automatic Detection:**
- Sessions detect working directory and git repo
- Stored in database for filtering

**Filter by Project:**
```bash
chronicle sessions --repo /path/to/project
chronicle timeline today --repo /path/to/project
chronicle summarize today --repo /path/to/project
```

## Key Features to Highlight

### Chunked Summarization
- Handles sessions of **unlimited size**
- Tested with 83,000+ line sessions
- Uses rolling summaries (10,000 lines/chunk)
- No rate limit issues

### Obsidian Integration
- Full MCP server integration
- Create structured session notes
- Search past work
- Build knowledge graph
- Wikilinks between sessions/commits/repos

### Local-First
- Everything stored locally (`~/.ai-session/`)
- SQLite database
- No data leaves your machine (except AI summarization)

## Common Questions

**Q: "Is this session being tracked?"**
A: Only if started with `chronicle start claude`. Must be explicit.

**Q: "Can I track a session retroactively?"**
A: No - must start with Chronicle from the beginning.

**Q: "How do I see what I did yesterday?"**
A: Use `chronicle timeline yesterday` or search Obsidian vault

**Q: "How do I link commits to sessions?"**
A: Automatic! Commits within Â±30 minutes of session are linked.

## Database Location

All data stored at:
```
~/.ai-session/
â”œâ”€â”€ sessions.db              # Main database
â”œâ”€â”€ sessions/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ session_N.log       # Transcripts
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ session_N.meta      # Metadata
â””â”€â”€ config.yaml             # Configuration
```

## Pro Tips

1. **Start Chronicle early** - Can't retroactively track
2. **Commit frequently** - Better session-commit linking
3. **Document important sessions** - Build knowledge base in Obsidian
4. **Search before building** - Use context retriever to avoid repeating work
5. **Use tags in Obsidian** - Makes finding past work easier
6. **Review summaries** - Helps remember key decisions

## Integration with Other Skills

- Use `chronicle-session-documenter` after completing sessions
- Use `chronicle-context-retriever` when starting related work
- Combine with git workflows for comprehensive tracking
