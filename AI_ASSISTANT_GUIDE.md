# Chronicle - Guide for AI Coding Assistants

> A quick reference for AI assistants (Claude Code, Cursor, Qwen Code, etc.) on how to help users track development sessions with Chronicle.

## Quick Start Workflow

**If user asks about Chronicle or session tracking:**

```bash
# Suggest this workflow to the user:
1. Exit current session
2. Run: chronicle start claude
3. Continue working (session is now being tracked)
4. When done: exit
5. View summary: chronicle session <id>
```

## Key Concepts

**Chronicle sessions are started MANUALLY:**
- User runs `chronicle start claude` BEFORE launching Claude Code
- This wraps the session and captures the full transcript
- Sessions are NOT automatically tracked - user must explicitly start tracking
- **You CANNOT start Chronicle from within an active session** (creates nested sessions)

**Auto-detection:**
- Sessions auto-detect the git repository based on working directory
- All commits made during the session are automatically linked
- Summaries can be generated on-demand with AI

## Common Commands to Suggest

```bash
# Starting a tracked session
chronicle start claude                # Track Claude Code session
chronicle start gemini                # Track Gemini CLI session
chronicle start qwen                  # Track Qwen Code session

# Viewing sessions
chronicle sessions                    # List recent sessions
chronicle session 5                   # View session #5 with AI summary

# Daily/weekly summaries
chronicle show today                  # See today's commits + AI activity
chronicle timeline today              # Combined timeline view
chronicle summarize today             # AI-generated daily summary

# Multi-project filtering
chronicle sessions --repo /path/repo  # Filter by specific project
chronicle show today --repo /path/repo

# Large session summarization
chronicle summarize-session 8         # Use Qwen CLI (bypasses rate limits)
```

## When Working IN the Chronicle Project

1. **Current session is likely NOT being tracked** unless user explicitly started it
2. **DO** use `chronicle session <id>` to view/debug past sessions
3. **DO** use `chronicle summarize-session <id>` for large sessions (>100KB transcripts)
4. **DO** query the database directly: `sqlite3 ~/.ai-session/sessions.db "SELECT ..."`
5. **DO NOT** run `chronicle start` from within an active session

## When Working on OTHER Projects

**Proactive suggestions:**
- "Would you like to track this session? Run `chronicle start claude` before we begin."
- "You can view a summary later with `chronicle session <id>`"
- "Chronicle will automatically track all commits we make during this session."

**After work is done:**
- "You can view what we accomplished with `chronicle session <id>`"
- "Or see today's work across all projects: `chronicle show today`"

## How Chronicle Works

1. **Session Recording:**
   - `chronicle start claude` launches Claude Code wrapped with Unix `script` command
   - Full terminal transcript is saved to `~/.ai-session/sessions/session_N.log`
   - Metadata saved to database (`~/.ai-session/sessions.db`)

2. **Summarization (Lazy):**
   - Transcripts saved immediately, summaries generated on-demand
   - First view of session triggers AI summarization (Gemini/Ollama)
   - Summary cached forever for instant future access
   - Transcript cleaned (ANSI codes removed, duplicates stripped) before summarization

3. **Commit Linking:**
   - Commits made within Â±30min of session are automatically linked
   - Repository auto-detected from working directory

## Storage Locations

- Database: `~/.ai-session/sessions.db`
- Session transcripts: `~/.ai-session/sessions/session_N.log`
- Configuration: `~/.ai-session/config.yaml`

## Troubleshooting

**"Session not being tracked":**
- Must run `chronicle start claude` BEFORE launching Claude Code, not during

**"Nested session error":**
- Cannot run `chronicle start` from within an already-tracked session
- User must exit and restart

**"Summary too short/incorrect":**
- Try `chronicle summarize-session <id>` for large sessions (bypasses rate limits)
- Uses Qwen CLI directly instead of Gemini API

## Example User Conversations

**User:** "How do I track this session?"
**AI:** "Chronicle needs to be started before the session begins. Let's exit and restart with `chronicle start claude` to track everything."

**User:** "Can you summarize what we did today?"
**AI:** "Yes! Run `chronicle show today` to see your commits and AI sessions, or `chronicle summarize today` for an AI-generated summary."

**User:** "I have multiple projects, how do I filter?"
**AI:** "Use the `--repo` flag! For example: `chronicle sessions --repo /Users/you/repos/my-project`"
